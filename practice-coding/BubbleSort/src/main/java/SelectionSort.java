/**
 * Selection sort works by searching the array and looking for the lowest value that we haven't sorted yet.
 * Then we move that element to the start of the array, swapping places with the element there.  Here's a breakdown
 * of the algorithm:
 *
 * 1. track the number of swaps we have made, -int swaps
 * 2. search the array for the lowest element - use temp variable
 * 3. swap that element with the first element in the array
 * 4. swaps++
 * 5. search a sub-array bounded by swaps - n
 * 6. repeat this process until swaps == n
